Libft project from 42


## First project as a Cadet.

At 42 Silicon Valley, cadets are those that have successfully passed and survived the harsh Piscine, also known as their intensive basic training, and was welcomed into their 1-3 year program.

42 encourages a very stringent standards on what their students can use to accomplish the program's objective. Things such as for loops, case-switch, and do-while loops are strictly forbidden, in addition to being limited to a very narrow selection of system calls.

Allowed functions for this project were only: write(), malloc(), and free(). Everything else-- any utility that we want, must be hand-coded ourselves. 

A system called Norminette enforces a certain coding convention so that all code between students is easily readable for peer-review purposes, in addition to challenging our creativity in developing solutions such as a line-limit of 25 lines per function and 5 functions per file. (Those particular limits negligible in this project because most of these are just minor utilities)

Any other 42 student wishing to seek ideas for how to solve some of these problems, you are very much encouraged to learn why these functions work, and become familiar enough so that they are easily replicatable off memory.
